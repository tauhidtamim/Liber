# Liber

Liber is an android application developed as a semester project for our undergraduate course, CSE 4643: Mobile Application Development. Liber is a Latin word, which translates to 'book' in English. It's an app for book cataloging purposes. Please see the demonstration, given below, to get a better understanding. The inspiration was taken from the popular social cataloging website, [Goodreads][goodreads]. **Please leave a star in the repo, if you like it, or it helps you in your own project. :)**
